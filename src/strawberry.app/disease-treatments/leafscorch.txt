# Treating Leaf Scorch Disease
Strawberry leaf scorch is a fungal disease caused by *Diplocarpon earlianum* that can significantly impact plant health and fruit production. Here's a comprehensive guide to treatment and management.
## Identifying Leaf Scorch
Before treatment, confirm the diagnosis by looking for these symptoms:
- Circular to irregular purple spots on leaves
- Spots develop tan to white centers with dark purple borders
- Affected leaves may appear scorched or burned
- Disease progresses from older to younger leaves
## Treatment Steps
### Immediate Actions
**Remove infected material**: Carefully remove and destroy all infected leaves as soon as you notice symptoms. This prevents the fungus from spreading to healthy tissue. Dispose of infected plant material away from your garden—do not compost it.
**Improve air circulation**: Thin out crowded plants and remove weeds to increase airflow around the strawberry plants. Good air circulation helps leaves dry faster, reducing conditions favorable to fungal growth.
### Fungicide Application
**Apply appropriate fungicides**: Use fungicides containing copper-based compounds, captan, or myclobutanil. Begin applications at the first sign of disease or preventatively in early spring.
**Follow application schedule**: Typically, fungicides should be applied every 7-14 days during wet weather or active disease periods. Always follow label instructions for proper timing and dosage.
**Rotate fungicide types**: To prevent resistance, alternate between different classes of fungicides rather than using the same product repeatedly.
### Cultural Management
**Water management**: Water plants at the base rather than overhead to keep foliage dry. Water early in the day so leaves can dry before evening.
**Mulching**: Apply clean straw or plastic mulch around plants to prevent soil-borne spores from splashing onto leaves during rain or irrigation.
**Plant spacing**: Maintain proper spacing (12-18 inches between plants) to promote air circulation and reduce humidity around foliage.
**Weed control**: Keep the strawberry bed weed-free to improve airflow and reduce competition for nutrients.
## Long-Term Prevention
**Choose resistant varieties**: When replanting, select strawberry varieties with resistance to leaf scorch, such as 'Surecrop', 'Delite', or 'Guardian'.
**Bed renovation**: After harvest, renovate strawberry beds by mowing off old foliage and removing debris. This eliminates overwintering fungal spores.
**Crop rotation**: Avoid planting strawberries in the same location for at least 3-4 years to break the disease cycle.
**Plant health**: Maintain plant vigor through proper fertilization and irrigation. Healthy plants are more resistant to disease.
**Fall cleanup**: Remove all old leaves and plant debris in fall before winter to reduce overwintering spores.
## Monitoring
Continue to inspect plants regularly throughout the growing season. Early detection and prompt action are key to preventing severe outbreaks. If disease persists despite treatment efforts, consider replacing the planting stock with disease-free plants and resistant varieties.
