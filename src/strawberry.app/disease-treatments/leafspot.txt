# Treating Leaf Spot Disease
Strawberry leaf spot is a common fungal disease caused primarily by *Mycosphaerella fragariae* (common leaf spot) and *Diplocarpon earlianum* (leaf scorch). Proper treatment involves both immediate intervention and long-term management strategies.
## Verify Leaf Spot
Confirm the disease by checking for these characteristic symptoms:
- Small, circular dark purple to reddish-brown spots on leaves
- Spots may have gray or white centers as they mature
- Heavily infected leaves turn yellow, then brown, and eventually die
- Disease typically starts on older leaves first
- Lesions may also appear on fruit stems and runners
## Treatment Steps
### Immediate Actions
**Remove infected foliage**: Promptly remove all leaves showing signs of infection. Cut off diseased leaves at the base and dispose of them in the trash—never in your compost pile, as this can spread the disease.
**Sanitize tools**: Disinfect pruning shears or scissors between cuts using rubbing alcohol or a 10% bleach solution to prevent spreading spores to healthy plants.
**Clear plant debris**: Remove fallen leaves, dead plant material, and any debris around the strawberry bed. Fungal spores can survive on decaying organic matter.
### Fungicide Treatment
**Select appropriate fungicides**: Effective options include:
- Copper-based fungicides (organic option)
- Captan
- Chlorothalonil
- Myclobutanil
- Sulfur-based products (organic option)
**Application timing**: Begin fungicide applications when new growth emerges in spring or at the first sign of disease. Continue applications throughout the growing season, especially during wet weather.
**Spray schedule**: Apply fungicides every 7-10 days during periods of active disease or wet conditions. Extend the interval to every 14 days during dry weather.
**Thorough coverage**: Spray both upper and lower leaf surfaces until they are completely wet. Focus on new growth, as young leaves are most susceptible.
### Cultural Management Practices
**Optimize watering**: Use drip irrigation or soaker hoses to water at the soil level. Avoid overhead watering that keeps foliage wet. If you must use sprinklers, water early in the morning so leaves dry quickly.
**Improve drainage**: Ensure the strawberry bed has good drainage. Standing water and excessive moisture promote fungal growth.
**Proper spacing**: Space plants 12-18 inches apart in rows 3-4 feet apart to allow adequate air circulation between plants.
**Mulch application**: Apply a 2-3 inch layer of clean straw mulch around plants to prevent soil splash, which can transfer spores from soil to leaves.
**Weed management**: Keep the bed free of weeds to improve airflow and reduce humidity around plants.
**Fertilization**: Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which produces lush, disease-susceptible foliage. Use balanced fertilizers according to soil test recommendations.
## Seasonal Management
### Spring
- Remove any dead or diseased foliage that overwintered
- Begin preventive fungicide applications as new growth emerges
- Apply fresh mulch after cleaning up old debris
### Summer
- Monitor plants weekly for new symptoms
- Continue fungicide applications during wet periods
- Remove runners if plants are becoming overcrowded
### Fall
- After final harvest, mow or cut back foliage to 1-2 inches
- Remove all clippings and debris from the garden
- Apply a final fungicide treatment before winter
### Winter
- In mild climates, remove any diseased leaves that appear
- Plan to renovate or replace severely infected plantings in spring
## Long-Term Prevention
**Plant resistant varieties**: Choose cultivars with better resistance to leaf spot diseases:
- 'Jewel'
- 'Allstar'
- 'Earliglow'
- 'Honeoye'
- 'Sparkle'
**Use certified disease-free plants**: Always purchase plants from reputable nurseries that guarantee disease-free stock.
**Bed renovation**: Renovate beds after 3-4 years of production. Old plantings become increasingly susceptible to disease.
**Crop rotation**: Don't plant strawberries in the same location more than 3-4 consecutive years. Rotate to a different area of the garden.
**Site selection**: Choose planting sites with full sun, good air circulation, and well-draining soil.
## Organic Treatment Options
For organic gardeners, focus on:
- Cultural practices (spacing, watering, sanitation)
- Copper or sulfur-based fungicides
- Neem oil applications
- Compost tea foliar sprays to boost plant immunity
- Baking soda sprays (1 tablespoon per gallon of water with a few drops of dish soap)
## When to Seek Additional Help
If leaf spot continues to be a severe problem despite treatment:
- Consider removing and replacing the entire planting with resistant varieties
- Have your soil tested for pH and nutrient imbalances
- Consult your local cooperative extension service for region-specific advice
## Monitoring and Record Keeping
Keep a garden journal noting:
- When symptoms first appear each season
- Weather conditions (rainfall, humidity)
- Treatment dates and products used
- Effectiveness of different control measures
This information helps you anticipate problems and time treatments more effectively in future seasons.

**Remember**: Consistent prevention and early intervention are far more effective than trying to control severe infections. Regular monitoring and prompt action at the first sign of disease will help keep your strawberry plants healthy and productive.
